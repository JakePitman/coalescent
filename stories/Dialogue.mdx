# Dialogue

The `<Dialogue/>` component is entirely context based, it receives no props. The following context is needed for this component to work:

`<Dialogue/>` does not need to be conditionally rendered. It can simply stay on the page, and will close itself visually whenever the current `dialogue`'s `text` property is `null`.

### The `<DialogueContextProvider/>`
   This provider contains the following information:

- `dialogue`: `{text: string | null, animationName: string}`
  - `text`: The text to be displayed in the dialogue box. If this is `null`, the dialogue box will animate to a close.
  - `animationName`: The animation that should be played when this dialogue is being displayed (handled by `<Robot />`)
- `dialogueSet`: `Array<{text: string, animationName: string}>`
  - The current set of dialogues. A dialogueSet represents a linear collection of dialogues to have their messages played in order
- `incrementDialogue`: `() => void`
  - This function increments the dialogueSet index, which in turn updates the `dialogue` object. In other words, it sets the dialogue to the next one in the dialogueSet. The `<Dialogue/>` component currently calls this function `onClick`
- `setDialogueSet`: `(page: PageNames) => void`
  - Changes the current dialogue set by passing in a page name (eg. `"/", "/interests"`). Each page name has a corresponding set of dialogues. The mapping from page name to dialogue is handled within the `DialogueContextProvider`. This function is called whenever the `page` from `usePageContext` is updated.


### The `PageContextProvider`
  Contains the following:

- `page`: `PageNames`
  - The current page name. The `DialogueContextProvider` is listening for changes to this value, and will update it's `dialogueSet` accordingly. 
- `setPage`: `(page: PageNames) => void`
  - Changes the current page name.

```tsx
  import { PageContextProvider } from "@contexts/pageContext";
  import { DialogueContextProvider } from "@contexts/dialogueContext";
  import { Dialogue } from "@components/Dialogue"

  const MyApp = () => {
    return (
      <PageContextProvider>
        <DialogueContextProvider>
          <Dialogue />
        </DialogueContextProvider>
      </PageContextProvider>
    )
  }

```
